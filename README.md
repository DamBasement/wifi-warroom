**Protocols are weak. Frequencies are open.**  
*This is a personal logbook of wireless warfare.*

## 🧭 Overview

This repository gathers all my field notes, attack flows, and technical references related to wireless hacking — from outdated WEP to modern WPA2-Enterprise networks.  
Every file is written to be terminal-friendly, SSH-compatible, and exam-ready (OSWP, real world, or just plain fun).

No GUI. No autopilot.
This repo is for those who weaponize terminals and read packets like poetry.
Manual attacks only — from raw capture to final crack.

## 🧵 Notes

All flows tested in controlled environments or lab simulations.  
Use responsibly — and never without authorization.
