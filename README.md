# WIFI-WARROOM

*Protocols are weak. Frequencies are open.*  
This is a personal logbook of wireless warfare.

## Overview

This repo collects field notes, attack flows, and technical references  
for wireless exploitation â€” WEP, WPA2-PSK, WPA2-Enterprise.

Everything is terminal-first and SSH-safe.  
No screenshots. No GUIs. Just command-line offense.
