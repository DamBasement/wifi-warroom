**Protocols are weak. Frequencies are open.**  
*This is a personal logbook of wireless warfare.*

## 🧭 Overview

This repository gathers all my field notes, attack flows, and technical references related to wireless hacking — from outdated WEP to modern WPA2-Enterprise networks.  
Every file is written to be terminal-friendly, SSH-compatible, and exam-ready (OSWP, real world, or just plain fun).

## 🧠 Philosophy

Forget point-and-click tools.  
This repo is about **manual mastery** — command-line only, no GUI, no fluff.
