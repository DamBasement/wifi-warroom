# üõ∞Ô∏è WiFi-warROOOOOOM

**Protocols are weak. Frequencies are open.**  
This is my war log ‚Äî a CLI-first battleground for wireless exploitation.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

A curated collection of **attack flows**, **field notes**, and **hands-on exploits**  
covering WEP, WPA2-PSK, and WPA2-Enterprise.

- No screenshots.  
- No GUIs.  
- **Just command-line.**

Perfect for red teamers, OSWP prep, or anyone who thinks air is free real estate.
